Dedicated and creative researcher who deeply loves to study connections amongst things, specifically between people and within people. 

Lover of mathematics. Interested in beliefs, cognition, environment, networks, systems, artificial intelligence, ethically innovative ideas of all departments, and interdisciplinary science.

I am advised by [Dr. Fil Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil) and [Dr. Zoran Tiganj](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/index.html?Zoran_Tiganj) with Indiana University Informatics and Computer Science. I am currently working towards my first paper regarding the use of language models to simulate humans in agent based models.
