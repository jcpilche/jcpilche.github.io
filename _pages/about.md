A dedicated, creative, interdisciplinary researcher who deeply loves to study the connections between people and within people, with interests in mathematics, cognition, neuroscience, networks and systems, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and ethically innovative ideas of all departments.

I am currently working towards my first paper regarding the use of language models to simulate humans in agent based models with [Dr. Fil Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil) and [Dr. Zoran Tiganj](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/index.html?Zoran_Tiganj) of Indiana University Informatics and Computer Science.
