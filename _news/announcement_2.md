Studies that use agent based simulations to learn more about topics within human society, with a monotone society of agents, have received the critique that they can't be realistic or applied due to their misrepresentation of a diverse human population. This study looks at the possibility of using prompt-engineered language models to more closely replicate a vast range of humans for agent based models, creating a more realistic group of agents that can draw more definite conclusions for social scientists. We create a population of politically opinionated language models by prompting them to be at a certain level on the US political scale. To these politically opinionated LLMs, we replicate a sample of an election survey done on humans and compare the similary of responses between humans and LLMs of the same political leaning. Our results show mediocre support for the ability to represent American political opinion with LLMs, as they often capture the stereotypical response of a political leaning but not the variance observed in the human political spectrum.
